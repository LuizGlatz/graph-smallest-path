# Graph - Smallest path
## About it
This project came about a college work about Graphs. I did an example with Brazil map, which consists of leaving one state and reaching another one with lower jump numbers.
My teacher suggested that I use the networkx to draw the graph.
## Operating flow
It works on four steps:
1st- Gets origin and destiny
2nd- Finds the smallest path (origin - destiny)
3rd- Finds the smallest path (destiny - path)
4th- Draws graph with the smallest path
